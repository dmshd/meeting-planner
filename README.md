# meeting-planner

A course a followed on Pluralsight.com (subscription e-learning IT platform) during my free time in october 2021.
Why I chose to learn this course : I'm currently day-working with an app that is made made of parts in django  and I needed to understand more.

The code produced following the course is available following this link : https://github.com/dmshd/meeting-planner
